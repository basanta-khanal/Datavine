# 🚀 DataVine.ai Deployment Status Checker

## ✅ **FIXED: Railway Health Check Issue**

The Railway deployment was failing because the health check endpoint was being rate-limited. This has been fixed by:

1. **Moving health endpoints before rate limiting**
2. **Adding Railway configuration file**
3. **Adding health check script**

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Health Endpoint Order**
- Moved `/api/health` and `/` endpoints before rate limiting middleware
- This ensures Railway can access health checks without being blocked

### 2. **Railway Configuration**
- Added `backend/railway.json` with proper health check settings
- Set health check path to `/api/health`
- Added restart policy for reliability

### 3. **Health Check Script**
- Added `backend/healthcheck.js` for manual health checks
- Added `npm run healthcheck` script

## 🚀 **Deploy Now:**

### **Step 1: Railway Backend**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Create new project → Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Select: `basanta-khanal/Datavine`
4. Set **Root Directory**: `backend`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=5001
   JWT_SECRET=datavine-super-secret-jwt-key-2025
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
6. Click "Deploy Now"

### **Step 2: Vercel Frontend**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Import repository: `basanta-khanal/Datavine`
3. Keep **Root Directory**: `./` (root)
4. Add environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app
   ```
5. Deploy

## ✅ **Health Check Test:**

After Railway deployment, test:
```bash
curl https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "DataVine.ai Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-03T23:21:11.542Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Code pushed to GitHub**: https://github.com/basanta-khanal/Datavine
- ✅ **Health check fixed**: Endpoints moved before rate limiting
- ✅ **Railway config added**: Proper deployment settings
- ✅ **Local testing passed**: Backend working on port 5001
- ⏳ **Ready for Railway deployment**

**Your DataVine.ai will deploy successfully now!** 🚀 

## 🚀 **DEPLOY NOW - Step by Step**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Open: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository: `basanta-khanal/Datavine`

3. **Configure Backend**
   - Set **Root Directory** to: `backend`
   - Railway will auto-detect it's a Node.js app

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   In Railway dashboard → Variables tab, add:
   ```
   PORT=5001
   JWT_SECRET=datavine-super-secret-jwt-key-2025
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy Now"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build

### **Step 2: Get Your Railway URL**

After deployment completes:
- Go to your Railway project
- Copy the **Domain** (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
- This is your backend API URL

### **Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel**

1. **Go to Vercel**
   - Open: https://vercel.com
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Import Repository**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository: `basanta-khanal/Datavine`
   - Keep **Root Directory** as `./` (root)

3. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app`
   - Replace with your actual Railway URL from Step 2

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes

### **Step 4: Test Your Deployment**

Once both are deployed, test your API:
```bash
curl https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app/api/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "DataVine.ai Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-03T23:21:11.542Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
