            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              At DataVine.ai, we believe that understanding your cognitive abilities is the first step toward personal
              growth and self-improvement. Our mission is to make professional-grade psychological assessments
              accessible to everyone, providing insights that were once only available through expensive clinical
              evaluations.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2024 by a team of cognitive psychologists and data scientists, DataVine.ai emerged from the
              recognition that traditional psychological testing was often inaccessible, expensive, and time-consuming.
              We set out to democratize cognitive assessment by leveraging cutting-edge technology and established
              psychological methodologies.
            </p>

            <h2>Scientific Foundation</h2>
            <p>Our assessments are based on well-established psychological testing frameworks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>IQ Assessment:</strong> Based on Raven's Progressive Matrices and WAIS-IV principles
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ADHD Screening:</strong> Adapted from ASRS-v1.1 and DSM-5 criteria
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Autism Screening:</strong> Based on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) research
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
              Our multidisciplinary team includes licensed psychologists, data scientists, and user experience designers
              who work together to ensure our assessments are both scientifically rigorous and user-friendly.
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
            <p>
              We take your privacy seriously. All assessment data is encrypted and stored securely. We never share
              individual results with third parties and comply with all relevant data protection regulations.
