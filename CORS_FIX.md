# 🔧 CORS Error Fix

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED: CORS Error from UI**

**Issue**: Register API was throwing CORS error from the frontend

**Root Cause**: CORS configuration was too restrictive and didn't allow requests from the frontend domain

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Improved CORS Configuration**
- Added support for multiple frontend domains
- Allow all origins in development mode
- Proper origin validation in production
- Added common Vercel domains to whitelist

### 2. **Development vs Production Handling**
- **Development**: Allows all origins for easier testing
- **Production**: Strict origin checking with whitelist

### 3. **Allowed Origins**
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:3001',
  'https://datavine-ai.vercel.app',
  'https://datavine.vercel.app',
  'https://datavine-git-main-basanta-khanal.vercel.app',
  'https://datavine-basanta-khanal.vercel.app'
];
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

**Local Test**: ✅ PASSED
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

**Response**: 
- Status: 201 Created
- CORS Headers: ✅ Present
- Registration: ✅ Successful
